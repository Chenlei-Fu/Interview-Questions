# Java Basic
### JVM, JDK, JRE & OpenJDK
#### JVM
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the virtual machine that runs the Java bytecodes. The JVM doesn't understand Java source code; that's why you need compile your *.java files to obtain *.class files that contain the bytecodes understood by the JVM. It's also the entity that allows Java to be a "portable language" (write once, run anywhere). 

#### JDK and JRE
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

It contains a JVM, among other things, and is what you need to run a Java program.

* Java Development Kit (JDK)

It is the JRE, but with javac (which is what you need to compile Java source code) and other programming tools added.

#### OpenJDK
A specific JDK implementation.
